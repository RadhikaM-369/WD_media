    <p>Here is about wikipedia</p>
    <blockquote>Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales[7] and Larry Sanger; Sanger coined its name as a blending of " wiki " and "encyclopedia ".[8][9] Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. In
        2006, Time magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyoneto edit had made Wikipedia the "biggest (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world "</blockquote>
